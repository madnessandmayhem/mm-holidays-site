We are delighted to announce that this year, M+M will be running a third week.

Week 3 will have everything you know and love about Weeks 1+2, but will be different to Weeks 1+2 in a couple of ways for 2026.

## Price
We're offering a special Launch Year price for Week 3 – £299, compared to £320 for Weeks 1+2.

## Madness+
For the first year of Week 3, we'll be running two age groups: Max (9-11), and Madness+ (12-16).

Weeks 1+2 will continue to offer the usual age groups of Max (9-11), Madness (12-14) and Mayhem (15-18). We hope to do this for Week 3 in future years.
